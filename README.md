### Hola! ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer, musician and data scientist who loves to travel. During the last couple of years I have been working as a consultant/freelancer for companies such as Thinkful/Chegg (Curriculum Developer / SME), eCornell (Curriculum Developer / SME), and Data Society (Data Science Instructor) among others. I've also worked as a software engineer for a bunch of companies based in California, NYC and Mexico City! I recently finished a master's in AI and I am doing another one in data science (yes, I am nerd). Every now and then, I give concerts and computer music workshops.

Favorite music: Classical, Jazz, Prog-rock & Electronic.
Countries I've been to: US, Canada, Mexico, Sweden, South Africa, England, and Swaziland.
Favorite food: Mexican, Italian, Indian, Lebanese.
Favorite programming languages: SuperCollider, Python, Scheme, R.
