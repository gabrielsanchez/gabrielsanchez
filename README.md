### Hola! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a technologist with expertise in software engineering, artificial intelligence, and quantum technology. I also enjoy making music, taking photographs, and exploring the world.  My professional experience includes consulting for companies like Thinkful/Chegg (Curriculum Developer/SME), Code.org (SME), and eCornell (Curriculum Developer/SME). My academic background is in Computer Science, AI and Quantum Technology (because learning is fun!).  I am based in San Antonio, TX, but sometimes I travel and work from different places.
