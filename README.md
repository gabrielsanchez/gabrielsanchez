### Hola! ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer, data scientist, and musician who loves to travel. During the last couple of years I have been working as a consultant for companies such as Thinkful/Chegg (Curriculum Developer / SME), eCornell (Curriculum Developer / SME), and Data Society (Data Science Instructor) among others. Before that, I worked as a software engineer for a bunch of companies based in California, NYC and Mexico City! I recently finished a master's in AI and I am always looking to learn new stuff. I am based in San Antonio, TX but I travel a lot and I usually work from different places.
